# Correlations-genetics-and-covariance
In the plant breeding one from principals studies is to know if one character are correlational with more characters in our population and  to know 
 if the correlations is for  genetics effect. Acording to  Falconer et al,. (1996) in the genetics stuies  it is necessary
 to distinguish two causes of correlation between character, genetics and 
 environmetal.
 The associoation between two characters that can be directly observed is the 
 correlation of phenotypic value or the phenotypic correlation. This is determined from
 measurements of the two character in a nunmber of individual. If we want  estimate the genotypic  correlations
  we need have the value genetic value, for this reazon the correlation genetics can be explain how
  the correlation of bredding value. Genetic covariances between traits can occur for two reasons, i.e.
(i) linkage/linkage disequilibrium; and (ii) pleiotropy.
I present how we can estimate the correlation genetics in R, in the first scrip i show step by step
acording  to methodologies described for Falconer (1996) and Chaudhary, B.D. (1987),
and the second script is the function, this script is for experiments with one environment , to more
environment just is necessary do small modifications. The data was taken from Biometrical Methods in Quantitative Genetic Analysis
